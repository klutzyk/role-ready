# RoleGuage

RoleGuage is a job-search workspace for jobseekers who want to apply with better focus. It compares a resume against a real job ad, scores fit, identifies evidence gaps, and turns the result into practical application notes.

## Product

This version includes:

- Resume and job description matching workflow

Saved applications and the saved resume profile are stored in browser `localStorage` for this local-first version. A production version should add account auth, encrypted database storage, payments, analytics, user-controlled deletion, and optional AI writing assistance.

Job URL import works best with company career pages and public ATS pages. Some large job boards block automated extraction, so the app keeps manual paste as the fallback.

Job discovery currently uses public feeds from Himalayas and Arbeitnow, then ranks listings with the same RoleGuage fit scorer used by the role matcher. Direct coverage for SEEK, Indeed, LinkedIn, and other major boards should be added through approved APIs, paid data providers, or official partnerships rather than brittle scraping.

## AI/RAG Architecture

RoleGuage uses a rules-first, AI-second architecture:

- Deterministic matching scores many jobs quickly and cheaply.
- Local RAG chunking retrieves only the most relevant resume and job snippets before generation.
- Gemini structured JSON output enriches selected reports and visible job summaries when `GEMINI_API_KEY` is configured.
- AI calls have timeout protection, in-memory caching, and deterministic fallbacks.
- The app never asks AI to invent experience; prompts require evidence-based, truthful guidance only.

Configure AI locally:

```bash
copy .env.example .env.local
```

Then add:

```bash
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-3-flash-preview
```
